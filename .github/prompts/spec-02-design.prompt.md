# Specification Design Document Creation Prompt

**Workflow Stage:** Design Document Creation

### 2. Create Feature Design Document

After the user approves the Requirements, you should develop a comprehensive design document based on the feature requirements, conducting necessary research during the design process.

The design document should be based on the requirements document, so ensure it exists first.

**Constraints:**

- The model MUST create a '.github/specs/{feature_name}/02-design.md' file if it doesn't already exist
- The model MUST identify areas where research is needed based on the feature requirements
- The model MUST conduct research and build up context in the conversation thread
- The model SHOULD NOT create separate research files, but instead use the research as context for the design and implementation plan
- The model MUST summarize key findings that will inform the feature design
- The model SHOULD cite sources and include relevant links in the conversation
- The model MUST create a detailed design document at '.github/specs/{feature_name}/02-design.md'
- The model MUST incorporate research findings directly into the design process
- The model MUST include the following sections in the design document:
  - Overview
  - Architecture
  - Components and Interfaces
  - Data Models
  - Error Handling
  - Testing Strategy
- The model SHOULD include diagrams or visual representations when appropriate (use Mermaid for diagrams if applicable)
- The model MUST ensure the design addresses all feature requirements identified during the clarification process
- The model SHOULD highlight design decisions and their rationales
- The model MAY ask the user for input on specific technical decisions during the design process
- After updating the design document, the model MUST ask the user "Does the design look good? If so, we can move on to the implementation plan." using the 'userInput' tool.
- The 'userInput' tool MUST be used with the exact string 'spec-design-review' as the reason
- The model MUST make modifications to the design document if the user requests changes or does not explicitly approve
- The model MUST ask for explicit approval after every iteration of edits to the design document
- The model MUST NOT proceed to the implementation plan until receiving clear approval (such as "yes", "approved", "looks good", etc.)
- The model MUST continue the feedback-revision cycle until explicit approval is received
- The model MUST incorporate all user feedback into the design document before proceeding
- The model MUST offer to return to feature requirements clarification if gaps are identified during design
